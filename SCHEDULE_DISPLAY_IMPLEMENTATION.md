### 3. `/src/components/scheduling/ScheduleDisplayDemo.tsx` (Demo Component)
- **Interactive demonstration** of the ScheduleDisplay component
- **Sample data** showing realistic scheduling scenarios
- **Conflict examples** to demonstrate conflict detection
- **Usage examples** for developers

## Integration Points

### With Existing System
- **Uses new TimeBlock types** from `lib/scheduling/types.ts`
- **Compatible with CSP solver output** (`ScheduleSolution` type)
- **Integrates with UI components** (shadcn/ui cards, buttons, badges)
- **Follows project patterns** (Tailwind styling, TypeScript, React hooks)

### With Future Components
- **Ready for CSP solver integration** - accepts `ScheduleSolution` directly
- **Compatible with AdaptiveCalendar** - shares TimeBlock data structures
- **Extensible design** - easy to add new view modes or features
- **Event-driven architecture** - callbacks for user interactions

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Component-based design** with separate view components (WeekView, DayView, ListView)
- **Memoized calculations** for performance optimization
- **Utility function separation** for reusability and testing
- **TypeScript throughout** with proper type safety

### Performance Features
- **Memoized metrics calculation** to prevent unnecessary re-computation
- **Efficient conflict detection** using O(n²) algorithm suitable for typical class sizes
- **Optimized rendering** with proper React keys and conditional rendering
- **Responsive design** that adapts to screen sizes

### User Experience
- **Multiple view modes** to suit different use cases and screen sizes
- **Visual conflict highlighting** with clear indicators
- **Interactive elements** with hover states and click handlers
- **Accessible design** with proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Export functionality** for integration with external calendar systems

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```typescript
import { ScheduleDisplay } from '@/components/scheduling';

<ScheduleDisplay
  solution={scheduleSolution}
  teacherSchedule={teacherAvailability}
  students={studentList}
  teacherName="John Doe"
  onExportCalendar={() => console.log('Export triggered')}
  onConflictClick={(conflict) => handleConflict(conflict)}
/>
```

### With Conflict Handling
```typescript
const handleConflictClick = (conflictedAssignments) => {
  // Show modal or navigate to conflict resolution page
  setShowConflictDialog(true);
  setSelectedConflict(conflictedAssignments);
};
```

### Export Integration
```typescript
const handleExport = () => {
  // Custom export logic
  analytics.track('schedule_exported');
  toast.success('Schedule exported to calendar');
};
```

## Data Flow

### Input Data
1. **ScheduleSolution** - Assignments from CSP solver
2. **WeekSchedule** - Teacher availability in TimeBlock format
3. **Person[]** - Student information for display
4. **Configuration** - Teacher name, callbacks, styling options

### Processing
1. **Group assignments by day** for week view organization
2. **Calculate utilization metrics** including usage rate and fragmentation
3. **Detect conflicts** by checking for overlapping time blocks
4. **Generate display data** with proper formatting and colors

### Output
1. **Visual schedule display** in selected view mode
2. **Metrics dashboard** showing utilization statistics
3. **Interactive elements** for conflict resolution
4. **Export functionality** for calendar integration

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features (from Phase 3)
- **Integration with CSP solver** for real-time schedule updates
- **Drag-and-drop rescheduling** for manual adjustments
- **Advanced conflict resolution** with suggested alternatives
- **Recurring schedule patterns** for semester planning

### Possible Extensions
- **Print-friendly view** with optimized layouts
- **Email integration** for schedule distribution
- **Notification system** for schedule changes
- **Multi-teacher support** for studio management
- **Historical schedule comparison** for optimization analysis

## Testing Strategy

### Component Testing
- **Visual regression tests** for all view modes
- **Interaction testing** for buttons and clicks
- **Data transformation testing** for metrics calculation
- **Conflict detection accuracy** with edge cases

### Integration Testing  
- **CSP solver compatibility** with real scheduling data
- **Calendar export validation** with various calendar systems
- **Mobile responsiveness** across device sizes
- **Accessibility compliance** with screen readers

### Performance Testing
- **Large dataset handling** (50+ students, 100+ assignments)
- **Rendering performance** with complex schedules
- **Memory usage optimization** for long-running sessions
